# portfolio-project by Nina Berggren

Very hard week, could only work during the weekend and my connection to github was lost some where along the vay so I couldn't hand in my project in time.

Uppdate Monday 19sep:

This weeks project was to create a portfolio built with HTML, CSS and JS it you wanted. If you are joining the career coaching program you had a pre designed figma file for layout to follow. 
The page should be fully responsible, look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. It should also work well for people who use screen readers and keyboard navigation and the code should validate in a validation tool.

Validation html:
https://validator.w3.org

Browser I'm working in on a macbook:
Crome

Crossbrowser testing:
Edge
Firefox

## The problem
I startde with mobile first, building my page according to design guidelines. It was ALOT of code to write and in addition the validation and the accessebility. I used the validation tool several times during my coading process. Did not get all the accessebility aria lables to work

If I had more time I would work more on the design and structure and minimize css code. Read up on the validation and the accessibility tools, since I think they are very important but sort of ended up in the shadow of all the html and css code that had to be written.
I would lern how to use voiceover.
